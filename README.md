# The Horde

A project management site created with react and firebase.

## What is The Horde?

This is a project build with the intent of helping a small team to better organize and manage their responsibilities when building a new app or adding features to an existing one. The theme of the site is based on a popular video game faction I love to play with friends, named 'World of Warcraft', but do not let that distarct you from the main focus of the app, which is creating and assinging team members to that specific project you are looking to build.

## Technologies:

- React:

  - Hooks

  - Custom hooks used to interact with firebase.

    - I know some them are already build in with Firebase v9, but I wanted to challenge and push myself for learning purposes.

- Firebase version 8:

  - Authentication

  - Firestore Database

  - Storage

  - Hosting

- JavaScript

- CSS

- Dependencies:

  - Date-fns: used in the project comments component to format the date.

## Setup

To run this project, install it locally using npm:

1. Download the ZIP files.

2. Navigate to the project root directory using your terminal of choice (I use Ubuntu).

3. Run `npm install` to install all of the project dependencies.

4. Run `code .` to open your code editor (optional).
