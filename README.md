# Ideally

A project management and idea sharing site created with react and firebase.

## Purpouse of Ideally

As stated above it is mainly a basic management tool for small teams but my main goal for this project was to practice firebase with react. The project was initially built with react v17, react-router-dom v5, and firebase v8 but has been updated since which resulted in a more clean, shorter and modularized code base which I assume was the intent behind the firebase v9 update.

## Technologies:

- React:

  - Hooks

  - Custom hooks used to interact with firebase.
 
- Firebase version 9:

  - Authentication

  - Firestore Database

  - Storage

  - Hosting
  
- CSS

- Dependencies:

  - Date-fns: used in the project comments component to format the date.
